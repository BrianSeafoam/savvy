  When I spoke to Chris Kadel, President at Polaris Solutions, he said his office was a ghost town. When I laughed he said, "That's good! Everyone is out working for our clients."
   
  [Polaris Solutions](http://www.polarissolutions.com) is an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and custom software development consulting firm that specializes in helping teams deliver high value software through technical leadership, process improvement, and software development expertise. They have locations in Chicago, Denver and St. Louis and currently employ about 30 consultants who work with Polaris Solutions' clients.
   
  Kadel, one of the company's founders, spends a lot of his time hiring these days. "We don't have underutilized people, everyone is working. Some quarters I focus on sales, but since the first of the year, I almost can't find enough people to bring on to the team."

  "Polaris is a little different. We hire for the career, not by project. We try to hire people that have a good long-term fit with us. We are always looking for good people, because we have to be ready for the demand, but we try to avoid re-actively hiring, or going too fast. If you do that you make a bad decision for the candidate, the clients and the company."

Jeff Kratschmer is Director of User Experience Design, Home Delivery, Member Experience at Express Scripts. He has 20 years of experience in digital design and multimedia product development, including specialties in user experience (UX), prototyping, web strategy and analysis, social media, and mobile web design.Â Jeff's team is growing, and I asked him about what he looks for when hiring coders and designers:


What demand do you see in the market for professionals to have some basic programming ability?

I think it's important from the perspective of having a knowledge base. I have two schools of thought--I think it's great that a designer can program their own stuff, it helps with design thinking to know how it will be built. On the other hand I don't want that to hinder the design. 

What type of professionals do you have the hardest time finding and hiring?

Quality digital designers. Here's what I mean, it's a plus that they can code, but I see a lot of very young people without a lot of experience, who might be mostly digital, but I can  grow them. I see a lot of  seasoned designers with a mostly print background that think they can do digital. Most still think in print terms in a lot of ways, and it's not the same thing. 


Who is your ideal employee?

Somebody that is not a baby bird. Somebody that can take direction, but doesn't need me to keep hovering. Someone who can take it and run with it, fail quick and we can fix it. Not someone needs constant feedback. Entrepreneurial.
