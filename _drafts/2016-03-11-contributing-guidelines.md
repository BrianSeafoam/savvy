## Welcome to the Savvy Coders blog

Thanks for contributing! A couple of things to note:
1. Everything on this page (and in every page) is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Use the toolbar above, or click the **?** button for formatting help.
2. There's a "draft to post" button on the top right... don't click that until it's time to publish! And your post won't show up instantly (yet), since Alex needs to rebuild the blog with every post (which is a good thing). 
3. You can write markdown outside of prose.io, too. Just copy->paste markdown content here to create a draft.
4. [Oxford commas are important](http://www.verbicidemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Oxford-Comma.jpg).
5. You can preview your formatting with the eyeball in the right-hand sidebar.
6. **Post Titles are Important.** Files are parsed and organized according to very specific naming conventions, which are automatically templated through prose.io. Filename format should always be `YYYY-MM-DD-lower-case-hyphen-separated-post-title.md`. 

Thanks again, and let Alex know if you have any questions!
