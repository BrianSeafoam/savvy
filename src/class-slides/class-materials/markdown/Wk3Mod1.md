## Building a Bookstore Part 1
### Halfway Hack-A-Thon!

**Congratulations!** Today we are at the halfway point in our class. Let's celebrate with a hackathon! A hackathon is a great opportunity to work on a larger, real-world(ish) project, while reviewing and solidifying the core concepts that we've covered in the first half of the course.

Today is the day we finally *MONETIZE*! We will build either an e-commerce store for our community site or a new hot startup to compete with Amazon.com. This will be a group project using the same GitHub workflow that we used for the Student Showcase website.

## Step 1: Make a Plan

1. Take a few minutes to brainstorm some project ideas related to the design of our bookstore. While we have a pretty solid step-by-step outlined below, there's still room for your team to decide how to divide up tasks and implement individual requirements with a bit of flair.
2. Some examples might include: will you use a CSS framework? What will the color scheme be? Which tasks should be taken by which team member?
3. Review the Step 3: Coding section below to consider the different concepts that we hope to practice during this project.
4. In your group, hold a standup meeting to present your plan of what you'd like to accomplish, and potential stumbling blocks.
5. If someone mentions being concerned about a concept that you feel solid on, offer to be a resource for them if they have questions.

## Step 2: Set up a GitHub repo

1. Fork and clone your integration manager/instructor's boilerplate for this project, and make sure that your remotes are set up correctly for the GitHub workflow!
2. If you or your team needs to review, take a look at Wk1Mod5.md.

## Step 3: Coding!

Let's get right to it! Each of these tasks should be tackled by a different team member. Remember to avoid stepping on any toes in the codebase, lest you find yourself with merge conflicts. Good Luck:

1. To start, take a look at `index.html`. Include jQuery, `reset.css`, and `minimal.css` (or another css framework) if you'd like.
2. Set up your HTML document such that there is a header, a nav bar, a content area, and a footer.
3. Inside the content area create `<div id="book1">` and `<div id="book2">` and place information about a book (or any other item) for sale in each div. Each product should have the following properties:
    ```
    name
    category
    price
    picture
    a list of selling points
    ```
